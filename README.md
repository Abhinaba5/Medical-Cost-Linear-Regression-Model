Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the most significant methods which is conducted using various statistical and data visualization techniques to understand the structure and characteristics of the data before applying more complex modeling or hypothesis testing.
- Implementing Multiple Linear Regression on the dataset for future prediction.
- Regularization techniques used to address over-fitting
- Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm is used to minimize the cost function as far as possible
